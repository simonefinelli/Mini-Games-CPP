# Overview
Space Invaders is a 1978 shoot 'em up arcade video game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. It was manufactured and sold 
by Taito in Japan, and licensed to the Midway division of Bally for overseas distribution. Space Invaders was the first 
fixed shooter and set the template for the genre. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a 
horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible... [Continue on Wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)

# Rules
Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen 
and fires at aliens overhead. The aliens begin as five rows of eleven that move left and right as a group, shifting 
downward each time they reach a screen edge. The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them. While the 
player has three lives, the game ends immediately if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen. The aliens attempt to 
destroy the player's cannon by firing projectiles. The laser cannon is partially protected by stationary defense bunkers
which are gradually destroyed from the top by the aliens and, if the player fires when beneath one, the bottom gets destroyed.
As aliens are defeated, their movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating all the aliens brings another wave 
which starts lower, a loop which can continue endlessly. A special "mystery ship" will occasionally move across the top 
of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed.... [Continue on Wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)
