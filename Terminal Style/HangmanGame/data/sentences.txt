THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES
TO BE OR NOT TO BE, THAT IS THE QUESTION
I HAVE A DREAM
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF
MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU
HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM
A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS
ROME WASN'T BUILT IN A DAY
EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING
ALL'S FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR
BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS
CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT
DON'T CRY OVER SPILLED MILK
A STITCH IN TIME SAVES NINE
WHEN IN ROME, DO AS THE ROMANS DO
YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS
AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY
BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER
DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORE THEY HATCH
THE EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE WORM
HASTE MAKES WASTE
IGNORANCE IS BLISS
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS IN THE EATING
WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S FIRE
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW
TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS
WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH GET GOING
THERE'S NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE
MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS
LOVE IS BLIND
IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO
THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE
A WATCHED POT NEVER BOILS
ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD
YOU CAN'T MAKE AN OMELETTE WITHOUT BREAKING EGGS
DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET
FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD
THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE GREASE
WHEN IN DOUBT, DO WITHOUT
A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED
ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER
BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER
EASY COME, EASY GO
LET BYGONES BE BYGONES
MISERY LOVES COMPANY
OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND
SPARE THE ROD AND SPOIL THE CHILD
THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE
THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME
YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS
BEAUTY IS ONLY SKIN DEEP
THE EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE WORM
HASTE MAKES WASTE
IGNORANCE IS BLISS
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS IN THE EATING
WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S FIRE
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW
MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES
LOVE CONQUERS ALL
ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER
DON'T CRY OVER SPILLED MILK
A WATCHED POT NEVER BOILS
WHEN IN ROME, DO AS THE ROMANS DO
THE ROAD TO HELL IS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS
THERE'S NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE
A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS
WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH GET GOING
YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING
THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE GREASE
THE MORE THINGS CHANGE, THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME
ALL'S FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR
BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS
CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT
DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORE THEY HATCH
THE EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE WORM
FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD
EVERY DOG HAS ITS DAY
YOU CAN'T MAKE AN OMELETTE WITHOUT BREAKING EGGS
NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION
A ROLLING STONE GATHERS NO MOSS
THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE
THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE LOCALHOST
YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO
A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER
DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET
A PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED
THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE GREASE
TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
WHEN IN DOUBT, DO WITHOUT
A WATCHED POT NEVER BOILS
ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD
