## Rules
The player have to guess a _secret sentence_ which is generated randomly by the
system.

Initially, the sentence is hidden by a series of dashes (except fot he white 
spaces). The Player have to guess the sentence, bit by bit, typing one letter
at a time: if a letter exists it is shown in the sentence, otherwise a body part
is added to the gallows.

The Player win if he guesses the entire sentence before the body is all drawn.
